<h3>Welcome to <strong>ifchic</strong>,</h3>

<p>
<span class="drop_cap_letter">O</span>ur inspiration came from ourselves, a group of young and professional women witholding various status in our daily lives. Some of us are single who enjoy a bit of cosmopolitan here and there; some of us are working mothers whose schedules are dictated by our little ones; some of us are  women working in the men’s world; and some of us get lifted with just a little cupcake in our 9 to 5 working days. All in  all, when we get a little time for ourselves, whether it’s morning waiting for brewing coffee or bedtime facial break, we all love to indulge ourselves with a little bit of pretty new wardrobe. With busy schedules and limited time, we love the convenience of shopping online, and needed a place that understands what it is like being a modern women,  and that’s how we came about. 
</p><p>
<strong>ifchic</strong> is a place tailored for the contemporary women and their busy lifestyles; we hand-pick our products among the sea of brilliant designers, and select the styles best suited for our lifestyle.  If you are like us, with endless tasks to be sorted everyday with a stylish heart, I think you will like what we have in store for you.
